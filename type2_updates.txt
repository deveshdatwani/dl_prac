ENGINEERING PROJECTS
HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION WITH CNN [GITHUB]
MAR 2022 - MAY 2022 | WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE                    
* Implemented the DeepPose paper to build a convolution neural network to estimate human body pose in 2 dimensions
* Created a TensorFlow pipeline to fetch and load the FLIC dataset and train an AlexNet on a Google Colab kernel 
* Observed convergence after 100 epochs and recorded mean squared error values of ~ 421 
TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION WITH MASK R-CNN [GITHUB]
SEP 2021 - DEC 2021 | WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE
* Implemented adaptations to the Mask R-CNN network to enhance its performance in detecting traffic signs
* Augmented a dataset of 10,000+ traffic sign images to create motion blur and condensation effect to improve model performance
* Helped enhance mAP values of the r-cnn model  from 0.05 to 0.25 on custom dataset after training it on the augmented dataset  
AERIAL VEHICLE DESIGN AND FLIGHT TESTING [PROJECT DOC]
2011 - 2020 | MUMBAI, INDIA
* Designed, fabricated and flight-tested remotely operated fixed-wing planes and quad copters
* Experimented with different power-plant, wing, composite material and electronic configurations 
* Gained hands on experience with aerodynamics, electronics and fabrication involved in aerial vehicle design after 200+ flights 
AIR FLOW INDUCTION WITH PLASMA ACTUATORS (APPLIED PATENT) [PROJECT VIDEO]
2017 - 2018 | MUMBAI UNIVERSITY
* Designed a research project on plasma actuators to induce air flow without the use of any moving elements 
* Sourced high voltage transformer 
* Designed and fabricated a plasma actuator inside hollow pipes with the pipe acting as a dielectric medium
* Observed and recorded wall bounded jet air flows of around 9000 litres/hr
