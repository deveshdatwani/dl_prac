    "The difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeableâ€”a sign of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. Two of them are data augmentation and adding a dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training examples. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating additional training data from your existing examples by augmenting them using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout Regularization: When you apply dropout to a layer, it randomly drops out (by setting the activation to zero) a number of output units from the layer during the training process. Dropout takes a fractional number as its input value, in the form such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, etc. This means dropping out 10%, 20% or 40% of the output units randomly from the applied layer."
